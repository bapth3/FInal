        <p>
          I was born and raised in Detroit along with my friend Jeremiah. We both grew up seeing stray animals as well as lost pets on the streets. We decided to start PawSearch because we knew the feeling of losing a pet, because cn feel like a member of the family and when they are gone, it feels like a part of your family is ripped away.
